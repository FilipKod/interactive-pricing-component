# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive pricing component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

I didn't have as much time as I expected, so this challenge took me longer than I wanted.
In the end, I'm glad I finished it.
